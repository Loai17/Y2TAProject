Hi TAs, hope you're excited for the summer! (If not, then this project will take you around 97.4 hours)<br>
You're supposed to create this <i>awesome</i> website that needs to cover most Y2 summer material.
<br>
<h2> Requirements </h2>
<ul>
<li>The website should have a minimum of 3 pages.</li>
<li>Good/Simple/Easy to understand/use Frontend.</li>
<li>Backend: Use advanced Python and Flask.</li>
</ul>

In case you need to review some of the material a bit, feel free to go to the summer's slides <a href="www.tinyurl.com/Y2Material">here</a><br> 
Hope you have fun working on this while keeping in mind CS is the best!
